Use Cases / Context
===================

Timesheets have a ``timesheet_invoice_type`` field which tells if they
are billable or not, and if billable of which type. In the
``sale_timesheet`` module, this field gets a billable type only when the
timesheet are linked to a sale order line.

When billing with recurring invoices using the OCA ``contract`` module,
we often work without sale order. So this module is useful to allow
correctly categorizing as billable timesheets on projects that are
billed using recurring contracts.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  A link between tasks and contract lines could be added, similar to
   what is done for sale order line.

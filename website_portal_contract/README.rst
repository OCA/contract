To edit the website template, go to:

* `Invoicing` in the top navigation.
* `Contracts` => `Website Templates`.
* When viewing a template in form view, click `View Template`.
  This will direct you to an edit page of the template in website if
  your user has edit permissions.

To view the live template in `My Account` in website, assign the template
to a contract and go to:

* Click on your username then select `My Account` in the dropdown.
* Click `Your Contracts`, then the relevant contract. Your template will show under
  the `Contract` section header, which is also shown in the edit template view for reference.

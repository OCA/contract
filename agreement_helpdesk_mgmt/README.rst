Odoo Agreement App does not provide an easy way to access helpdesk tickets
related to an agreement. Some organizations need to have a quick access to
helpdesk tickets to track the performance of an agreement.

This module allows you to link a helpdesk ticket to an agreement and adds a
smart button on the agreement to look at the list of related helpdesk tickets.

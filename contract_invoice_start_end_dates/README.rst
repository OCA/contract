Contract Invoice Start End Dates
================================

This module sets the *Start Date* and *End Date* on recurring invoice lines generated from a contract.

The fields *Start Date* and *End Date* on invoice lines are added by the module *account_cutoff_prepaid* for Odoo v8 (module *account_invoice_start_end_dates* on Odoo v9+) hosted on the OCA project `account-closing <https://github.com/OCA/account-closing>`_.

Configuration
=============

On the contract, depending on the configuration of the parameter *Start/End Dates Option*, the generated recurring invoice will cover the past period or the future period.

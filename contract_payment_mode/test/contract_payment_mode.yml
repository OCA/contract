  In order to test payment mode in contract, I create a contract with custom payment mode.
  Then, I generate Invoices from contract and test this payment mode.
  First create custom payment mode.
-
  !record {model: payment.mode, id: custom_payment_mode}:
    name: Custom Payment Mode
    journal: account.bank_journal
    bank_id: account_payment.partner_bank_1
    company_id: base.main_company
    type: account_banking_payment_export.manual_bank_tranfer

  I create a contract with custom payment mode
-
  !record {model: account.analytic.account, id: contract_custom_payment}:
    name: Maintenance of Servers
    company_id: base.main_company
    partner_id: base.main_partner
    payment_mode_id: custom_payment_mode
    type: contract
    recurring_invoices : 1
    recurring_interval : 1
    recurring_invoice_line_ids:
      - quantity: 2.0
        price_unit: 100.0
        name: Database Administration 25
        product_id: product.product_product_consultant
        uom_id: product.product_uom_hour
-
  I test the payment mode in contract
-
  !python {model: account.analytic.account}: |
    aid = ref('contract_payment_mode.contract_custom_payment')
    contract = self.browse(cr, uid, aid,context=context)
    assert contract.payment_mode_id.id == ref('contract_payment_mode.custom_payment_mode'), "Payment Mode is not correct in contract"
-
  I generate all invoices from contracts having recurring invoicing
-
  !python {model: account.analytic.account}: |
    self.recurring_create_invoice(cr, uid, [])
-
  I test the generated invoice for custom payment contract
-
  !python {model: account.invoice}: |
    aid = ref('contract_payment_mode.contract_custom_payment')
    ids = self.search(cr, uid, [('invoice_line.account_analytic_id','=',aid)], context=context)
    assert len(ids)>=1, 'No invoice created for the custom paymetn mode contract'
    for invoice in self.browse(cr, uid, ids,context=context):
        assert invoice.payment_mode_id.id == ref('contract_payment_mode.custom_payment_mode'), "Payment Mode is not correct in invoice"

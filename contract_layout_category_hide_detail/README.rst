This module allows you to check/uncheck 'Show details' and
'Show subtotal' flags for *Recurring invoices section lines*
in Customer Contracts and Supplier Contracts so that
Invoices are generated with this information.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Invoicing -> Customers -> Customer Contracts* and create
   a new *Contract*.
#. In *Recurring Invoices* tab add a section line.
#. Add some product lines.
#. Add a section line, but this time, click on the *plus-circle*
   icon |plus-circle-icon| on your right. That icon will be replaced by
   *minus-circle* icon |minus-circle-icon|. That means *Show subtotal* field is
   set to False. (You can also set *Show subtotal* field to False/True
   in the pop-up form when you click on the section line)
#. Add some product lines.
#. Add another section line and click on the *eye* icon |eye-icon| on your
   right. That icon will be replaced by *eye-slash* icon |eye-slash-icon|.
   That means *Show details* field is set to False. (You can also set
   *Show details* field to False/True in the pop-up form when you
   click on the section line)
#. Add some product lines.
#. Then, when the Invoice is generated, you will see that it will have the
   information regarding "Show details" and "Show subtotal" specified in
   the previous steps.

For more information about *Show details* and *Show subtotal* flags in
Invoices: see `'Usage' section of the 'Sale layout category hide detail'
module <https://github.com/OCA/sale-reporting/tree/12.0/sale_layout_category_hide_detail#usage>`_

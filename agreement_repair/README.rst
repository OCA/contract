Odoo Agreement App does not provide an easy way to access repair orders related to an agreement.
Some organizations needs to have a quick access to repair orders to track the performance of an agreement.

This module allows you to link a repair order to an agreement and
adds a smart button on the agreement to look at the list of related repair orders.

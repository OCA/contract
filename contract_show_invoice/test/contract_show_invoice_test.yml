  In order to test Contract Invoices Button I create a new Contract
-
  !record {model: account.analytic.account, id: contract_main}:
    name: Maintenance of Servers
    company_id: base.main_company
    partner_id: base.main_partner
    type: contract
    recurring_invoices : 1
    recurring_interval : 1
    recurring_invoice_line_ids:
      - quantity: 2.0
        price_unit: 100.0
        name: Database Administration 25
        product_id: product.product_product_consultant
        uom_id: product.product_uom_hour

  I test the invoices button
-
  !python {model: account.invoice}: |
    contract_id = ref('contract_show_invoice.contract_main')
    invoices = self.search(cr, uid,[('analytic_account_ids','=',contract_id)],context=context)
    assert len(invoices) == 0, "No invoices related this contract, but get (%s)"%(invoices,)
-
  I generate all invoices from contracts having recurring invoicing
-
  !python {model: account.analytic.account}: |
    self.recurring_create_invoice(cr, uid, [])

Configuration
=============

1. Go to Invoicing > Configuration > Contracts > Formulas (quantity).

   'result'.

   You can use these variables to compute your formula:

   -  *env*: Environment variable for getting other models.
   -  *context*: Current context dictionary.
   -  *user*: Current user.
   -  *line*: Contract recurring invoice line that triggers this
      formula.
   -  *contract*: Contract whose line belongs to.
   -  *invoice*: Invoice (header) being created.

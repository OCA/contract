Odoo Agreement App does not provide an easy way to access project tasks related to an agreement.
Some organizations needs to have a quick access to project tasks to track the performance of an agreement.

This module allows you to link a project task to an agreement and
adds a smart button on the agreement to look at the list of related project tasks.

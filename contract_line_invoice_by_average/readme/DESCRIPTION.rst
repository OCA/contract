This module allows you to define products on a contract that needs to be invoiced by the average quantity instead of the sum.

For example, you may have a contract for 3 water dispensers and have 4 sales orders in a month for a total of 15 bottles of water. Your invoice would be:

    * 3 water dispensers
    * 5 bottles
